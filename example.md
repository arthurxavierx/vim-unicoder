Linear distributions are fundamental in the proof theory of linear logic:

  (A ⊗ (B ⅋ C)) ⊸ ((A ⊗ B) ⅋ C).

The Modal Modus Ponens is given by:

  □(φ → ψ), □φ ⊢ □ψ.

The gradient theorem reads as follows:

  Let φ : U ⊆ ℝⁿ → ℝ and s is any curve from p to q. Then

    φ(q) - φ(p) = ∫ₛ ∇φ(r) ∙ dr.
